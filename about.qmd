Hi I'm Storm! I am transfer student at California State Monterrey Bay, where I am studying Environmental Science with a data science minor. I was previously at Monterrey Peninsula Community College, where I received my Natural Science and Social Sciences associate's degree. When I'm not in school or studding I'm either work, volunteering at the Aquarium or practicing Karate.
