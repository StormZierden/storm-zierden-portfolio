Hi I'm Storm! I am transfer student at Califronia State Monterey Bay, where I am studying Enviromental Science with a data science minor. I was perviously at Monterey Peninsula Community College, where I received my Natural Science and Social Sciences associate's degree. When I'm not in school or studing I'm either work, voluntering at the Aquarium or practicing Karate.
